    <H1>Introduction to Sarah</H1>
	<div style="text-align:center">
	</div>
    <P>Hello readers, I am Sarah! I attend UGA and am a Psychology major. My horoscope sign is Libra, I'm 5'2", and my favorite color is blue. I live with my dad, step-mom, and little brother. I have two older half-siblings, one nephew named Liam, and two nieces named Leia and Ariah. Sadly, I have no pets but I am hoping to get a cat next semester. I have moved many time througout my life. I've moved a lot throughout my life and have lived in Phenix City, Alabama, Columbus, GA, Lawrenceville, GA, Duluth, GA, and a few other places that I can't remember when I lived in a womens' shelter with my mom. My hobbies are reading, watching movies and shows, drawing, pressing flowers, going to concerts, and listening to music.</P>

	   <li>Harry Styles</li>

	 <H3>Rating Songs on Gorilaz's album <u>Plastic Beach</u></H3>
	 <table border=1>
	 <div style="text-align:center">
	 </div>
	 <P>Earlier today, I was listening to the album <u>Plastic Beach</u> by Gorillaz. I have decided to create a table below of my 5 favorite songs off the album below:
	 
	 <tr>
	    <th>Ranking #</th><th>Song Title</th><th>Why Do I Like the Song</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td>1</td><td>"Rhinestone Eyes"</td><td>This song is my favorite in the album because I never get tired of listening to it.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td>2</td><td>"Empire Ants"</td><td>I love this song due to the featured band Little Dragon in it, as well as the music in the background.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td>3</td><td>"On Melancholy Hill"</td><td>This song makes me think about environmentalism and how bad we treat our earth.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	     <td>4</td><td>"White Flag"</td><td>This song is really cool because of the Arabic influences in it.</td>
	<tr>
	<td>5</td><td>"Glitter Freeze"</td><td>I like this song because the music in the background reminds me of when you zip a zipper.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
